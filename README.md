# R-BioGeochemistry
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and RQ-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of geochemical and biogeochemical data for use in mineral exploration and environmental studies. 

These scripts are designed to take you through censoring (the replacement of missing values using k-neareast neighbour and the imputation of upper or lower detection limit values using ilr), clr-transformation and RQ-PCA.

Please note that these scripts use R-packages that are protected under their own licenses and it's recommended that each license is reviewed prior to use.
